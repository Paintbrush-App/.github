## About Paintbrush
Paintbrush represents a focused approach to image editing that prioritizes simplicity, speed, and accessibility over complex feature sets. Designed as a lightweight alternative to resource-intensive graphic applications, it provides the essential tools needed for everyday image tasks without overwhelming users with advanced options they may never use. This philosophy makes image editing approachable for casual users, students, and anyone who needs to perform basic graphic tasks without investing time in learning sophisticated software interfaces or dealing with performance overhead associated with professional editing suites.

The application distinguishes itself through its streamlined interface that presents tools and options in an intuitive layout, minimizing the learning curve while maximizing practical utility. Unlike more complex graphics applications that bury basic functions within nested menus, Paintbrush keeps essential operations immediately accessible, making it ideal for quick edits, simple illustrations, and educational purposes.
